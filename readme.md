# Apple Device Check

On an iOS device you can use [Device Check](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck) to help reduce fraudulent use of your services by managing:
- [Device State](#device-state).
- [Asserting App Integrity](#asserting-app-integrity).

This project is a sample Cloudflare worker that works in conjuction with the [@capacitor-community/device-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capacitor-community/device-check) plugin to provide functionality for DeviceCheck.
